# About Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mamta1999/cardiovascular-risk-data)
The Cardiovascular-risk repository contains a dataset that provides information on over 4,000 patients, focusing on assessing the risk factors associated with Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CHD). The dataset encompasses 15 attributes, each representing a potential risk factor for CHD. These attributes cover various aspects such as demographic information, behavioral patterns, and medical risk factors.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals interested in studying the relationship between different factors and cardiovascular health. By leveraging this dataset, one can gain insights into the potential risk factors that contribute to CHD, allowing for more effective preventive measures, improved diagnostic methods, and targeted treatment strategies.

# Technologies Used
This project employs several cutting-edge technologies to analyze the dataset and derive meaningful conclusions. The following technologies were utilized:

**TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework widely used for developing and training neural networks. It provides a powerful and flexible platform for building predictive models, making it an ideal choice for analyzing complex datasets like the Cardiovascular-risk dataset.

**Neural Networks:** Neural networks are a key component of this project, enabling the modeling and prediction of CHD risk based on the dataset attributes. These networks are designed to learn patterns and relationships within the data, allowing for accurate predictions and valuable insights.

**TensorFlow Feature Columns:** TensorFlow Feature Columns provide a convenient and efficient way to preprocess and represent the features of the dataset. By utilizing this feature, the project ensures that the data is appropriately formatted and ready for training the neural network models.

The combination of TensorFlow, neural networks, and TensorFlow Feature Columns enables the creation of sophisticated models that can effectively analyze the Cardiovascular-risk dataset and provide valuable insights into the risk factors associated with CHD.
